# Copilot Instructions for Automatizate Web

## Project Overview
- The project is structured into two main directories: `client` (Vue.js) and `server` (NestJS).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```
2. Use Docker Compose to run the application:
   ```bash
